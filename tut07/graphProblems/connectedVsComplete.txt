A connected graph is:
    - A graph, where for any pair of vertices (v, w), there exists
        a path that goes from v to w

A complete graph is:
    - A graph, where for any pair of vertices (v, w), there exists
        an edge that commects v to w

Which of these implications are true? How could you prove/disprove them?
    connected => complete?
    complete => connected?
